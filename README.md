# Rethinking-GRC-From-Checklists-to-Code

Traditional Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is outdated—designed for a world of static servers and quarterly audits. In today’s cloud-native world, where infrastructure changes by the second, that old-school, checklist-heavy approach just can’t keep up.

This report explores the shift to **GRC engineering**—a discipline that treats compliance and security like software. It’s not about doing SOC 2 “better.” It’s about asking smarter questions:

- What are we actually protecting?
- What would failure *really* cost?
- How do we know our protections are working?
- And most importantly—how do we improve faster than the threats evolve?

## Why It Matters

- GRC isn’t just paperwork anymore—it’s infrastructure.
- Controls should be code, not manual processes.
- Evidence should be real-time telemetry, not screenshots.
- Security shouldn’t slow down innovation—it should *enable* it.

We explore how leading organizations like Amazon and Google apply first-principles thinking and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to rebuild GRC from the ground up. Think automation, continuous monitoring, and data-driven decisions.
